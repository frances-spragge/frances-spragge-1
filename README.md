## **Background**

* Currently a DPhil candidate on the [Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP (BBSRC)](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/interdisciplinary-bioscience?wssl=1), Magdalen College, University of Oxford (2018-22)

* Biological Sciences BA (Hons), Somerville College, University of Oxford (2015-18)

* A-levels in Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Philosophy. AS-level English Literature


## Interests

* Microbiomes

* Social evolution

* Antibiotic resistance


## Research

* Undergraduate research project (Department of Plant Sciences) on whether foreign pollen can inhibit pollen tube formation and reduce seed set. Involved growing and pollinating lilies, preparing and staining pistils, fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Statistical analysis of data in R Studio.

* Project rotation in the Griffin Lab (Department of Zoology) researching beta-lactamase secretion by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. (January to April 2019)

* Project rotation in the Foster Lab (Department of Biochemistry/Zoology) studying competition and cooperation between species of commensal gut bacteria. (April to July 2019)

* I have continued my DPhil in the [Foster Lab](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk) and am now investigating the ecological interactions between commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria and how they evolve over time. I use *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* as model pathogens and carry out work in vitro and in vivo.
